OneNoteInker
============

Transfers ink from a Word document to a OneNote page when copy and paste fails

============
Uses InkMLTk (http://sourceforge.net/projects/inkmltk/) which is included because InkMLTk is no longer under development and has a number of bugs (or at least incompatibilities with what I was trying).

Does not support transferring pressure values for some reason.

Right now, it's built specifically for converting a single document, but it can be extended (even to insert fake ink that comes from an arbirary non-pen source).
